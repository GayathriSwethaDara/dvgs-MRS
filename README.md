I have developed a Movie Recommendation System! Here, I curate finest movies for users to explore using **OMDb API**. Additionally, users have the opportunity to create their own personalized playlists featuring their favorite films. These playlists are publiclly accessable.

**Register page** consits of Name, Email, Password, Repeat Password and Contact No.
**Login Page** consists of Username and Password with authentication.
**Home Page** consists of Navbar (Search, Logout, Username) with routing, About website with contact and Footer.
**Search Page** consists of search box to search for a movie by title, when clicked on movie poster it shows movie details like name, rating, actors, descrption etc. You can add it to your watchlist by click bookmark button and can remove it from watchlist by clicking dustbin button.
